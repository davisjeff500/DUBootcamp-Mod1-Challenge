<h2>Solution Method</h2>

This repo contains the refactored code solution to the DU Bootcamp Module 1 Challenge.  I analyzed the code of both the index.html and the style.css.  I looked for ways to substitute sematic html for the existing non-semantic code in the index.html  I refactored the syle.css to merge redundant code and streamline. I commented the code to clarify method and intent. I finished by formatting the code according to best ppractices.
